TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a transport layer protocol used for establishing a reliable, ordered connection between two devices for the purpose of data transfer.

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, which means that a connection must be established before data can be exchanged between devices. The process of establishing a connection is known as the three-way handshake. The three-way handshake consists of the following steps:

The initiating device, also known as the client, sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the receiving device, also known as the server. This packet serves as a request to initiate a connection.

The server receives the SYN packet and sends back a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) packet to the client. This packet serves as an acknowledgement of the connection request and also contains the initial sequence number for the server.

The client receives the SYN-ACK packet and sends back an ACK (acknowledge) packet to the server. This packet serves as a confirmation that the connection has been established.

Once the connection is established, data can be exchanged between the devices. TCP uses a sliding window mechanism for flow control and error checking. The window is a range of sequence numbers that the sender is allowed to transmit. The receiver sends back an acknowledgement for each packet received, which updates the window and allows the sender to transmit more data.

TCP also provides error checking through the use of checksums. The checksum is a value calculated from the data in the packet and is used to verify the integrity of the data. If the receiver calculates a different checksum value than the one sent in the packet, it discards the packet and requests that it be retransmitted.

When the devices are done with the data transfer and no longer need the connection, the connection is closed through a process known as the four-way handshake. The four-way handshake consists of the following steps:

The initiating device sends a FIN (finish) packet to the receiving device to indicate that it is finished sending data.

The receiving device sends back an ACK packet to confirm receipt of the FIN packet.

The receiving device sends its own FIN packet to the initiating device to indicate that it is also finished sending data.

The initiating device sends back an ACK packet to confirm receipt of the FIN packet.

TCP is a reliable and widely-used protocol, but it can be relatively slow due to its error checking and flow control mechanisms. It is typically used for applications that require reliable data transfer, such as email, file transfers, and web browsing.

At a low level, the implementation of the TCP protocol involves the use of several key data structures and functions.

TCP segments: TCP uses a segment as the basic unit of data transfer. A segment consists of a header and a payload. The header contains various fields that are used for flow control, error checking, and connection management. Some of the key fields in the TCP header include the source and destination port numbers, the sequence and acknowledgement numbers, and the flags that indicate the status of the connection.

TCP sockets: A socket is a endpoint for sending or receiving data across a network. Each socket has a unique combination of an IP address and a port number that identifies it. In the TCP implementation, sockets are used to represent the connection between the two devices. The socket on the sending device is used to send data and the socket on the receiving device is used to receive data.

TCP buffers: Buffers are used to store data temporarily as it is being sent or received. The sending device uses a transmit buffer to store data before it is sent and the receiving device uses a receive buffer to store data as it is received.

TCP state machine: TCP uses a state machine to manage the connection. The state machine keeps track of the current state of the connection and the events that occur during the connection. Each event, such as receiving a SYN packet, can cause the state machine to transition to a new state, such as the SYN-RECEIVED state.

Flow Control : TCP uses a sliding window mechanism for flow control. The window is a range of sequence numbers that the sender is allowed to transmit. The receiver sends back an acknowledgement for each packet received, which updates the window and allows the sender to transmit more data.

Error checking: TCP uses a checksum to ensure the integrity of the data. The checksum is a value calculated from the data in the packet and is used to verify the integrity of the data. If the receiver calculates a different checksum value than the one sent in the packet, it discards the packet and requests that it be retransmitted.

Retransmission: If a segment is lost or corrupted in transit, the receiving device does not send an acknowledgement, this will cause the sender to retransmit the segment. TCP uses a retransmission timeout mechanism to handle lost segments. If an acknowledgement is not received within the timeout period, the sender will retransmit the segment.

Congestion Control: TCP uses a congestion control algorithm to prevent network congestion. The algorithm is used to adjust the sending rate based on the current network conditions. The most common algorithm used is the TCP Vegas.

Timer: TCP uses various timers to manage the connection and retransmission. The retransmission timer is used to determine when a segment should be retransmitted, the keep-alive timer is used to detect when a connection has been lost, and the connection timeout timer is used to determine when a connection should be closed.

All those functions and data structure are implemented in the TCP/IP stack of the Operating System and are handled by the kernel.
